# TruthEngine™ — Projects & Architectures

TruthEngine™ is expressed through multiple architectures and systems.

Some are public.
Some are private.
Some exist only as internal reference implementations.

This document provides a high-level overview of select TruthEngine™-based work without exposing implementation details.

## Architectures

### Night Architect by TruthEngine™

A reference architecture demonstrating TruthEngine™ principles at the infrastructure level.

Focus areas include:
- Zero-trust networking
- Fail-closed system behavior
- Cryptographic enforcement
- Deterministic trust boundaries
- Attack-surface minimization

Night Architect is designed to operate quietly and defensively, prioritizing verification over availability.

---

## Systems & Implementations

### Network & Infrastructure Systems
TruthEngine™ principles are applied to hardened routing, transport enforcement, and boundary security across controlled environments.

---

### Cloud & Edge Logic
TruthEngine™ informs edge-based filtering and pre-origin enforcement logic designed to eliminate untrusted traffic before it reaches core systems.

---

### Application Security
TruthEngine™ concepts are applied to application-layer security, verification-aware workflows, and integrity-first software design.

---

### Trust & Verification Research
Ongoing research explores physical presence validation, behavioral trust signals, and correlation-based verification mechanisms.

---

## Status

Not all projects are publicly documented.
Not all implementations are intended for release.

TruthEngine™ evolves through disciplined iteration, not public timelines.

---

## Attribution

Select systems may reference:
- “Powered by TruthEngine™”
- “Implements TruthEngine™ principles”

Such references indicate architectural lineage, not certification or endorsement.
