# TruthEngine™

**TruthEngine™** is a systems-level trust, verification, and security engine designed to provide fail-closed architectures, behavioral validation, and cryptographic integrity across networks, software, and distributed platforms.

This repository establishes **authorship, intent, and original design provenance** for the TruthEngine™ concept and its related systems.

## Night Architect by TruthEngine™

**Night Architect** is a flagship architecture built on TruthEngine™ principles, focused on:

- Zero-trust networking
- Fail-closed security design
- Cryptographic enforcement over untrusted layers
- Physical + behavioral presence validation
- Deterministic system boundaries
- Attack-surface minimization

Night Architect is designed to operate across:
- Network infrastructure (e.g., OpenWrt-based systems)
- Cloud logic (e.g., edge workers and filters)
- Application security layers
- Verification-aware software systems

---

## Design Principles

TruthEngine™ systems follow these core principles:

- Trust is proven, not assumed
- Untrusted layers are made irrelevant
- If integrity cannot be verified, the system halts
- Presence must be intentional
- Behavior is a stronger signal than identity
- Security is enforced at the first trusted boundary
- Systems must fail closed, not degraded

## Status

This repository currently serves as:

- A **design origin record**
- A **conceptual specification**
- A **timestamped authorship anchor**

Implementation details, specifications, and production code will be added incrementally.
