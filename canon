# TruthEngine™ Canon

This document defines the immutable principles and constraints that govern all TruthEngine™ systems.

Anything that violates this canon is not TruthEngine™.

---

## Purpose

TruthEngine™ exists to enforce truth, not availability.

Systems built on TruthEngine™ principles prioritize:
- verification over convenience
- integrity over uptime
- correctness over recovery

If trust cannot be proven, the system must stop.

---

## Canonical Principles

### 1. Trust Is Proven, Not Assumed
No system, user, network, or component is trusted by default.
Trust must be established through verification at the point of use.

---

### 2. Untrusted Layers Are Made Irrelevant
If a layer cannot be trusted, it must not influence system integrity.

Untrusted transport, infrastructure, or identity signals are treated as hostile and bypassed or cryptographically constrained.

---

### 3. Systems Must Fail Closed
When verification fails, the system halts.

There is no graceful degradation when integrity is uncertain.
Continuing in an unknown state is considered a failure.

---

### 4. Integrity Precedes Availability
A system that is available but unverified is insecure by definition.

Availability is optional.
Integrity is not.

---

### 5. Presence Must Be Intentional
Access and authority require deliberate action.

Passive signals are insufficient.
Intent must be observable and verifiable.

---

### 6. Behavior Is a Stronger Signal Than Identity
Identity can be forged.
Behavior is harder to fake consistently.

TruthEngine™ systems privilege behavioral validation over static identifiers.

---

### 7. Enforcement Occurs at the First Trusted Boundary
Security is enforced as early as possible.

Untrusted input must never propagate inward.
Verification happens before processing, not after damage.

---

### 8. Determinism Over Ambiguity
TruthEngine™ systems favor deterministic outcomes.

When uncertainty cannot be resolved, the system must choose denial over guesswork.

---

## Architectural Consequences

As a result of this canon:

- Attack surfaces are minimized, not monitored
- Logging supports enforcement, not justification
- Recovery requires re-verification, not rollback
- Silence is preferred to noisy failure
- Explicit unlocks replace implicit access

---

## Canon Enforcement

Any system claiming to implement TruthEngine™ principles must adhere to this canon.

Violations indicate either:
- misunderstanding
- incomplete implementation
- or misrepresentation

The canon does not evolve casually.
Changes require deliberate architectural justification.

---

Truth is enforced.
Trust is proven.
Nothing proceeds without both.
